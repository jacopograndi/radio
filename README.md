This is the implementation of the game designed and reviewed in the thesis. The game features:
1. Networking infrastructure using UDP sockets with added reliability features.
2. Deterministic parallel traffic simulation with optimizations (grid indexing, graph indexing, precalculation of collisions and graph stars).
3. In-game voice chat emulating a half-duplex radio, in which only one player can talk at a time.
4. Asymmetric multiplayer: players are divided into couriers and radio-operators.
5. Video feed: the radio operators can see the screens of the couriers in-game.
6. Unity Editor tools to create and develop maps for the game.
7. Modular city blocks that can be composed to make maps quickly.
